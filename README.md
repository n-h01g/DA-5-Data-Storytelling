### Project Details

For this project, I adopted the role of a data science consultant for a large production company and used the Movies Metadata dataset to provide insights on key takeaways for a specific problem statement. I created a ghost deck with an effective problem statement, scope analyses, bias analyses, and a set of potential recommendations. I then performed various analysis to understand and find insights from the dataset. Lastly, I put it all together to provide a well-supported final recommendation.  

#### Executive Summary
The movie production characteristics (including production company, budget, release date and runtime) of the next “Big Hit” in each movie genre can be predicted using previous movie successes!

Some highlights of the detailed analysis of movie data include:

- Universal Production Company have made the most profit having produced the most movies, whilst Ingenious Film Partners made the most profit in a single movie through Avatar
- Big movie budgets do not simply equate to big profits 
- Horror, Romance and Comedy genre movies have the greatest profit gain compared to budget input
- Late Summer tend to have fewer movie releases identifying an opportunity for release of future movies when competition will be lower
- Adventure, Action and History movies have, on average, the longest runtimes, whilst Animation, Documentary and Family movies have the shortest

A recipe card describing the key movie production characteristics (including production company, budget, release date and runtime) for each movie genre has been derived and is our recommendation for the next “Big Hit”!
